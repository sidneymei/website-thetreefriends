## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for our interactive visualization website, exploring traffic accidents in Chicago. The website is the culmination of our CS424 project, utilizing data from the "[Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if)" dataset provided by the City of Chicago.

**Live Website**: [sidneymei.github.io/website-thetreefriends](https://sidneymei.github.io/website-thetreefriends)

**Note**: Visualizations may take some time to load and might be affected on mobile devices.

## Features

Our website offers a range of interactive visualizations categorized into:
- Single View
- Multiple Views
- Multiple-Linked Views
- Spatial Views

### Key Visualizations

1. **Calendar Heatmap**: Displays daily crash patterns throughout the year.
2. **Choropleth Map & Bar Graph**: Shows crashes per police beat and injuries based on speed limit.
3. **Dot Plot & Multiple Line Graph**: Provides temporal insights into crash conditions.
4. **Bubble Map**: Illustrates spatial distribution of crashes across Chicago.

## Data Processing

We performed several data transformations to ensure the quality and relevance of our visualizations:
- Removed documents with geocoordinate points outside city boundaries.
- Omitted features with more than 3% missing data.
- Conducted feature engineering for each visualization.

## Visualization Techniques

Our visualizations employ various encoding techniques:
- Marks: Area, Lines, Points
- Channels: Position, Color, Shape, Size, Length

## Interactions

- Tooltips on hover for detailed insights.
- Linked interactions between complementary visualizations.
- Filtering options using dropdowns and sliders.

## Key Findings

- Data is heavily skewed towards crashes with little to no injuries.
- Downtown areas, including the Loop and Grant Park, are crash hotspots.
- Most crashes occur during normal conditions (clear weather, dry roads).
- Varying posted speed limits don't necessarily correlate with crash likelihood.

## Technical Details

- Visualizations are rendered using Vega-Lite.
- The website is not fully responsive due to limitations with Vega-Lite.
- Visualizations may be affected when the browser window is resized.

## Future Work

Potential areas for improvement and expansion include:
- Enhancing mobile responsiveness.
- Incorporating real-time data updates.
- Expanding the analysis to include multi-year trends.

## Acknowledgements

We thank the City of Chicago for providing the dataset and our course instructor for guidance throughout this project.
